title: About me
<!-- subtitle: --> 
---

I'm Tom, currently Head of IT, with a passion for solving real-world problems through the Microsoft tech stack. Over the last few years, I’ve been fortunate to lead a talented team while diving deeper into the power of low-code tools like Microsoft's Power Platform.

My journey started with technical problem-solving, but over time I found just as much satisfaction in mentoring others and streamlining business systems. Most recently, I've been exploring how Power Platform can transform productivity and unlock solutions for SMB.

This space is partly my own digital notepad - document and revisit. But more importantly, I hope it's useful for others looking to learn, troubleshoot, or refine their own approach to development.

I believe in building solutions that help people develop - not just get things done. Whether it's simplifying a tedious process, creating a new tool, or making documentation or process make more sense, I aim to save people time and empower them to develop their own skills.

If something you read here helps you out or sparks an idea, I’d love to hear about it. Feel free to connect, share, or just say hi.
